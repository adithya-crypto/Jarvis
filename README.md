## Jarvis Voice Assistant

Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based project that allows you to interact with your computer using voice commands. Inspired by the fictional AI assistant in the Iron Man movies, this project enables you to perform various tasks hands-free.
Features
* Voice Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize voice commands spoken by the user.
* Speech Synthesis: Employs the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech, providing auditory responses to the user's commands.
* Time-Based Greetings: Greets the user according to the time of the day - "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", or "Good Evening".
* Web Search: Can perform web searches using Wikipedia and open various websites such as YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow.
* Media Control: Allows the user to play music stored locally on their device.
* Email Sending: Enables the user to send emails by voice command using the smtplib library.
* Screen Brightness Control: Adjusts screen brightness based on user commands.
* Phone Number Details: Provides details about a phone number including its country and service provider using the phonenumbers library.
* Location Retrieval: Retrieves the user's current location using their IP address with the requests library.
